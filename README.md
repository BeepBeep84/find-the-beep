# Find The Beep

Inspired by *Find the Fox* by Alex Cheddar, this puzzle avoids forming the word “BEEP” in a dynamic grid of the letters B, E, and P.

## 🔢 How it Works
- Users choose grid dimensions (minimum 4×4)
- The grid is generated in the browser using JavaScript
- The code prevents “BEEP” from appearing in any direction
